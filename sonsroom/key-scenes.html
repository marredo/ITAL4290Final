                        <p>These scenes show how <em>The Son's Room</em> looks at adolescence, family, and grief in a very intimate way.</p>
                        
                        <header>
                            <h2 style="border-top: 2px solid #CFB87C; border-bottom: none; padding-top: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">1. The Missed Run and the Dive</h2>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> Early in the film, before the tragedy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Andrea asks his dad Giovanni to go running with him. Giovanni plans to go but gets called in for an emergency therapy session. Andrea instead joins friends for a scuba dive. We don't see the accident directly at first, only the family's shock when they learn what happened.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This scene anchors Andrea as a normal teenager with simple plans—running, hanging out, sports. The missed run becomes a small but painful "what if" for Giovanni and shows how fragile everyday routines are. In the exhibition's theme, this is the moment where a typical adolescent life is suddenly interrupted, similar to how Chiara's normal world in <em>A Chiara</em> is shattered overnight, and how Caterina's calm provincial life is disrupted when she moves to Rome.</p>
                        
                        <header style="border-top: 2px solid #CFB87C; border-bottom: none; padding-top: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <h2>2. Irene's Basketball Outburst</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> After the funeral, during one of Irene's games.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Irene plays in a basketball match, but her emotions boil over. She suddenly lashes out at another player and starts a fight on the court. Coaches and teammates are stunned; this is not "normal" behavior for her.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Irene is a teenager who doesn't have the words for her grief. The family is quiet and closed, so her body speaks instead—through aggression and loss of control. This scene shows how adolescents can act out when they have no safe space to process trauma. It parallels Chiara's restless wandering and confrontations in <em>A Chiara</em>, and Caterina's confusion and drift between friend groups in <em>Caterina in the Big City</em>. In all three films, young people express inner chaos in sideways, sometimes self-destructive ways.</p>
                        
                        <header style="border-top: 2px solid #CFB87C; border-bottom: none; padding-top: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <h2>3. Arianna's Visit and Andrea's Room</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> Later in the film, after Andrea's parents find a letter from a girl named Arianna.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Giovanni and Paola contact Arianna, Andrea's girlfriend. She visits the family and sees Andrea's room, now frozen in time. She shares photos Andrea sent her, showing him joking around, posing, and looking very alive. The family listens and watches, seeing their son through another teenager's eyes.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This scene rebuilds Andrea as a real person, not just a loss. Through Arianna's memories, we glimpse his teenage identity—his humor, affection, and day-to-day life. It also helps the family begin to move from pure grief to a more complicated, living memory of him. For the exhibition, this scene connects directly to youth perspectives: it shows how one adolescent's story is carried on by another, just as Chiara and Caterina carry the weight of their own experiences in their films.</p>
