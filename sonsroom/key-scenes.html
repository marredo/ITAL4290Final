                        <p>These scenes show how <em>The Son's Room</em> looks at adolescence, family, and grief in a very intimate way.</p>
                        
                        <header>
                            <h2 style="border-top: 2px solid #CFB87C; border-bottom: none; padding-top: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">1. The Missed Run and the Dive</h2>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> Early in the film, before the tragedy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Andrea asks his dad Giovanni to go running with him. Giovanni plans to go but gets called in for an emergency therapy session. Andrea instead joins friends for a scuba dive. We don't see the accident directly at first, only the family's shock when they learn what happened.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This scene anchors Andrea as a normal teenager with simple plans like running, hanging out, sports. The missed run becomes a small but painful "what if" for Giovanni and shows how fragile everyday routines are. In the exhibition's theme, this is the moment where a typical adolescent life is suddenly interrupted, similar to how Chiara's normal world in <em>A Chiara</em> is shattered overnight, and how Caterina's calm provincial life is disrupted when she moves to Rome.</p>

                            <h2>2. Irene's Basketball Outburst</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> After the funeral, during one of Irene's games.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Irene plays in a basketball match, but her emotions boil over. She suddenly lashes out at another player and starts a fight on the court. Coaches and teammates are stunned; this is not "normal" behavior for her.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Irene is a teenager who doesn't have the words for her grief. The family is quiet and closed, so her body speaks through aggression and loss of control. This scene shows how adolescents can act out when they have no safe space to process trauma. It parallels Chiara's restless wandering and confrontations in <em>A Chiara</em>, and Caterina's confusion and drift between friend groups in <em>Caterina in the Big City</em>. In all three films, young people express inner chaos in sideways, sometimes self-destructive ways.</p>

                            <h2>3. Arianna’s Visit and the Photos in Andrea’s Room</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is:</strong> Later in the film, when Arianna arrives in Ancona.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Arianna, who describes herself as “Andrea’s friend,” comes to the family’s apartment. She apologizes for an earlier phone call, asks to see Andrea’s room, and explains that it “meant a lot” to her. She pulls out printed photos that Andrea took with a timer in his room, he wanted to show her his space. Giovanni and then Paola look through the photos with her, seeing Andrea posing, joking, and inhabiting his room.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The scene lets us see Andrea as a teenager through another teenager’s eyes. The printed photos and Arianna’s memories make his room feel alive again, not just a shrine. For the exhibition’s theme, this moment is about youth identity preserved in fragments: images, stories, and objects that remain after a young life ends. It also nudges the family toward movement, they begin to remember Andrea as a full person, not only as a loss. Which echoes how Chiara and Caterina, in their films, try to carry their own experiences forward into an uncertain future.</p>
