                        <p><strong>Where it is</strong></p>
                        <p>Early in the film, right after Caterina and her parents move from the small town to Rome.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
                        <p>Caterina walks into her new classroom for the first time. The teacher and students are already deep in a loud discussion about politics and current events. Two very different groups of classmates stand out: the alternative, left-leaning kids around Margherita, and the stylish, right-wing rich kids around Daniela. Caterina mostly watches and listens, unsure where she fits.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                        <p>This scene drops us into Rome through Caterina's eyes: a place where even teenagers talk like adults about politics and culture. It captures adolescence as a time of feeling out of place and being asked to "pick a side" before you even know who you are. The contrast between Caterina's provincial background and her confident, wealthy classmates also sets up the film's class tension. Right away, the classroom becomes a mini-map of Italy's social and political divides, and Caterina is caught in the middle.</p>

                            <h2>2. Pulled into the Left-Wing Crowd</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is</strong></p>
                        <p>Soon after the first days of school, when Caterina starts hanging out with Margherita and her friends.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
                        <p>Margherita invites Caterina into her world: they listen to music, talk about protests and writers, and go to a political gathering. Caterina is flattered by the attention and tries to follow along with the big ideas and slogans. She copies the group's clothes and attitudes, but it's clear she's still testing things out and doesn't fully share their certainty.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                        <p>Here we see how adolescence often means trying on identities borrowed from friends. Caterina is not so much "left-wing" as she is eager to belong. The scenes with Margherita's circle show how politics, music, and style blur together into one package for these teens. At the same time, their comfort and cultural capital mark them as a specific class: educated, urban, and secure. Through Caterina's hesitation, the film suggests that adopting an ideology is very different from actually understanding it, and that a shy provincial girl can get swallowed up by other people's labels.</p>
                        
                        <div style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center;">
                            <img src="../media/afterschool-light.gif" alt="Caterina with Margherita and the left-wing crowd" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                        </div>
                        
                        <header style="border-top: 2px solid #CFB87C; border-bottom: none; padding-top: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            <h2>3. Party with the Right-Wing Elite</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Where it is</strong></p>
                        <p>Midway through the film, after Caterina starts spending more time with Daniela and the rich, right-wing clique.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
                        <p>Caterina is invited to a glamorous party at Daniela's home. The apartment is huge, filled with well-dressed adults and teenagers, loud music, and expensive food. Daniela's father, a powerful politician, appears as the center of attention. At one point, the mood shifts from harmless fun to something more unsettling, as guests show their loyalty with nationalist songs and gestures. Caterina watches all of this, both dazzled and uneasy.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                        <p>This scene shows the other side of Caterina's "big city" education. Instead of bohemian rebellion, she's now tasting luxury and proximity to power. As a teenager, it's easy for her to confuse this access with real belonging. The party underlines how class and politics are tied together: the right-wing world here is not just an opinion, but a lifestyle built on money and connections. For Caterina, the party is another test of identity. She can enjoy the glamour, but she can't ignore the darker signals in the room. The film uses her mixed feelings to question what kind of adult world these teens are being invited into.</p>
